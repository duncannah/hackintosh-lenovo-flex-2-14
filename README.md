# **OpenCore** Hackintosh configuration for Lenovo Flex 2-14

**DEPRECATED: I no longer maintain this repository as I no longer use this laptop. Use at your own risk.**

This repository contains the files required to run a Hackintosh on a Lenovo Flex 2-14 (i3-4030U, Intel HD 4400) **using OpenCore 0.6.2**.

Tested on macOS 10.14.5 (Mojave).

**You'll need to add your own serial and such into `PlatformInfo` (`MLB`, `SystemSerialNumber`, and `SystemUUID`) in config.plist.**

Working:

-   Ethernet
-   iCloud
-   Hardware acceleration

Not working:

-   WiFi (for now)
